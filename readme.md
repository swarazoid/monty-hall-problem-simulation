The Monty Hall problem can be confusing at first. When there are only three doors, it might seem like it doesn't matter whether you switch or not, as the chances should be 50-50. However, running simulations repeatedly and increasing the number of doors shows that switching doors significantly increases your chances of winning. In fact, with three doors, your initial chance of picking the right door is only 33.3%.
